# VHDL

A respositry for all my VHDL projects. 

It contains a main file and a testbench:
- All the logical gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR)
- A full adder and subtractor
- A half adder and subtractor
- A 2-to-1 multiplexer
- An simple 8-Bit ALU (Addition, subtraction, all logic gate operations)
- All latches and flip flops (D, JK, T, SR)
- BCD/Modulo-10 Counter with Asynchronous active-low reset (4 -bits)
- A Moore-type Finite State Machine (FSM) as a BCD counter with a stop signal
- 4-Bit Synchronous Up/Down Counter with Asynchronous active-low reset (Count range between 0 and 15)
- Modulo-13 counter with enable and Asynchronous active-low reset (4-bits)
- Modulo-15 counter with enable and Asynchronous active-low reset (4-bits)
- 4-Bit binary counter with Asynchronous active-low reset
- 4-Bit binary counter with enable, asynchronous active-low reset, and synchronous clear
- Moore-type FSM as a 2-Bit counter
- 4-Bit Synchronous counter with parallel load
- 4-Bit Parallel access shift registers - Shift to left and right
- 8-Bit register with enable and asynchronous reset
- N-bit register with enable, synchronous clear, and asynchronous reset
- Mealy FSM as a sequence detector with overlap
